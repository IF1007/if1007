## 3.2. Documenting microservices

The traditional approach of API documentation is either by writing service specification documents or using static service registries. With a large number of microservices, it would be hard to keep the documentation of APIs in sync.

Microservices can be documented in many ways. This homework intend to explore how microservices can be documented using the popular **Swagger** framework.

Create a new **Spring Starter Project** and select **Web** in the library selection window. Name the project ``lecture3.swagger``. Learn how to use **Springfox Swagger** library e using a similar ``bootrest`` project, show the results.
